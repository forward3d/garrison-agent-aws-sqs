Garrison Agent - AWS SQS
--

This is a part of the [Garrison](https://github.com/forward3d/garrison) security project. This agent mainly provides compliance alerts and other basic checks.

### Checks Provided

| Function Name | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `check_dlq_retention` | Checks that the DeadLetterQueues have the max message retention period |
| `check_encryption` | Checks that the queues have encryption enabled |
| `check_redrive` | Checks for queues without a redrive policy (excluding those acting as one) |

### Installation & Example

Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/r/forward3d/garrison-agent-aws-sqs/

    docker pull forward3d/garrison-agent-aws-sqs
    docker run --rm -e "GARRISON_URL=https://garrison.internal.acme.com" forward3d/garrison-agent-aws-sqs check_encryption

#### AWS Authentication

As this requires access to the AWS API you will need this IAM policy as a minimum for it to operate correctly.

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Action": [
                    "sqs:ListQueues",
                    "sqs:GetQueueAttributes"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }

We recommend using EC2/ECS Task roles so that you don't need to send credentials into the container, however if you can't use those or want to send in specific Access Keys and Secret keys, please see the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-config.html#aws-ruby-sdk-credentials-environment) as to how you do that.

### Check Specific Configuration

Some checks provided by this agent have extra configuration options.

| Environmental Variable | Default |

| `GARRISON_SQS_MESSAGE_RETENTION_THRESHOLD` | `1209600` (14 days) |
